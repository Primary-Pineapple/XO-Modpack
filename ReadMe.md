# GT Online - Modpack

### Read me coming soon. I'm lazy with documentation.

## What am I building?
A 1.20.X modpack, focused around Gregtech Community Edition (u) - Modern.
Heavy emphasis on online play & large scale exploration & adventure.

Custom content, structures & dimensions are part of the plan.

## Frequently Asked Questions
#### What is the modpack name?
Xplore! - Or, Xplore Online, XO, GTXO - Look not really sure at this point.

#### What kind of modpack is this?
Relatively, I'd like to think its going to be a first of it's kind. An Adventure/Questing pack with the primary goal being to advance in technology you have access to. Visiting different dimensions and planets along the way. The big difference with XO is the heavy encouragement of online play! This pack is specifically designed to be played with friends. It has economy and group boss fight mechanics. Really excited to bring my plans to life.

#### What is PrimaryPineapples background?
Minecraft Player for many years, long time in the modded scene, but my passion is typically around hosting / multiplayer infrastructure, and pack dev. I love having an idea and then putting it together using rescoures from the awesome community we have here in Modded Minecraft.

#### Will there be quests?
Yes, and achivements. The pack will provide you with quests to do and a path to follow if you want too. But the pack will never force you to follow a specific route. There will always be more than one way to go about things, leaving the direction up to you.

#### When is the pack going to be available?
Not Soon.

#### What version will Xplore be available on? 
Either 1.20.1 or 1.20.x depends where Mojang finishes up and how well the modded scene matures on whiich sub-version. You know how Mojang loves to put in those breaking changes on minor versions. **Sigh.**

#### Can I play an alpha version?
No. There is no playable version of the pack yet.

#### On launch, where will the pack be available?
CurseForge.
